## 📄Description - Exercise Statement

### Exercise 1

Create a class named "Telèfon" (Phone) with the attributes `marca` (brand) and `model`, and the `trucar()` (call) method. This method must receive a String with a phone number. The method must display a message on the console saying that the number received as a parameter is being called.

Create an interface named "Camera" with the method `fotografiar()` (take photo), and another interface named `Rellotge` (Clock) with the method `alarma()` (alarm).

Create a class named "Smartphone" that is a subclass of "Telèfon" (Phone) and also implements the "Camera" and "Rellotge" (Clock) interfaces.

The `fotografiar()` method must display on the console: “S’està fent una foto” (A photo is being taken) and the `alarma()` method must display: “Està sonant l’alarma” (The alarm is ringing).

From the application's `main()`, create a Smartphone object and call the previous methods.
